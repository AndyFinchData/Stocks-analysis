# Stocks-analysis
1. The purpose of this Challenge was to turn our multiple step process of analyis, formatting, asking which year, to all flow at once to speed up our code. Refactoring is a term for taking a step back and rethinking to make a cleaner code.

In looking at the other tickers with similar results like DQ, we see AY and JKS both decreased dramatically after successful 2017s. On the other hand, several unsuccessful 2017 stocks bounced back in 2018 like VSLR, SEDG, RUN, and HASI. Finally, there were a few stocks that either stayed in the red or green year to year. Respectfully, these include CSIQ, FSLR, and SPWR on the red side while ENPH and TERP both were positive through both years.
3a. The advantages of refactoring code is to speed up your ability to analyze large data sets with regard to for loops and also to make sure we can step back from complicated code because there is usually another way to write it, possibly cleaner. If we just stick to our guts, we may face problems as the code gets more and more complex, simply because it is not in the right particular order. Also, as we write more and more code, we get more familiar with complex problems by learning how efficient we can be. Disadvantages of refactoring could be whilst you are rewriting, you run into new bugs in your code which will need further troubleshooting than you might have already solved in previous attempts.
3b. The refactoring of the original analysis code definitely apply here as I learned more about iteration, indexing, while increasing mastery of for loops and setting variables. I definitely ran into new bugs I had not experienced before refactoring, mainly with the indexing portion and making sure I was using the right.
